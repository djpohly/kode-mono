    A custom-designed typeface explicitly created for the developer community.
</p>
<p>
    This typeface is designed to enhance the user experience and reflect Kadena's principles of functionality and
    timelessness. The Kadena brand's clean and elegant design is a powerful symbol of the project's commitment to security,
    scalability, and decentralization. We are now extending this brand with the K-Grid.
